## Add Whatthefetch to Your PATH

To run `Whatthefetch` from anywhere in your terminal, move the compiled executable to a directory in your `PATH`.

### For your user only

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv Whatthefetch ~/.local/bin/
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`. You can check with:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If itâ€™s not, add this line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc
```

### For all users (requires elevated priveleges, use `su`, `sudo`, `doas` or log in as root`

```bash
sudo mv Whatthefetch /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you can run:

```bash
Whatthefetch
```

from any directory!
